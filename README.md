## Scope of improvement for Production

- The project need a database integration, currently the databse functionaly is achieved using hardcoded values for user info and browser localStorage for questions
- Signup Page should be added, but couldn't because databse is not involved
- Many objects can be give custom types like Question, Element, Title, Options etc. but they are currently given a normaly objects with type as any
- Syling can be improved to be a lot better, but time required for designing
- Some elements were not added to the elements Panel, simply because lack of understanding of there functionality and due to lack of time. Eg. Progress Bar, Timer, Multiple Select Options.
- Validations and checks can be added to user events, for example not allowing blank questions or questions without correctAnsewer to be saved, etc.
- Elements added to the canvas are fixed for now, but the can also be made draggable to adjust their position or to remove them. But couldn't impliment to avoid complexity that due to lake to time.
- Marking scheme can be implimented, setting marks for correct answer for each question
- currently image is saved as a url, but can we stored in cloud storage in the production

## Furter Implimentation
- Similar app structure can be extended or used to create other designing Apps like, picture book or courses. It will require more variety of the elements
- one good example of such app is Canva desiging app.
